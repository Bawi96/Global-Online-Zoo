<h1>Hello Welcome to our Global Online Zoo</h1>


<h3>A zoo is a place where animals live in captivity and are put on display for people to view. The word “zoo” is short for “zoological park.” Zoos contain wide varieties of animals that are native to all parts of the Earth.The timetable is at 7:30 a.m in the morning to 10:30 a.m and we will open again at 12:00 in the afternoon if u want to know why we closed 10:30 to 12:00 it just because we need to fill thir food and water so thats why.</h3>
<h3>We have some animals such as like tiger or something and they can't eat you because you are in internet and you can see some land animals, Aquatic animal, aeiral animals & Amphibian.There are cute animals & creepy animals</h3>
